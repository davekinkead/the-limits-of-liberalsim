## Two

## Democracy & Stability

----

1. Democracy requires limits to remain stable
2. Those limits can be either liberal of illiberal
3. If we want to avoid oppression, they must be liberal
3. Therefore democracy requires liberalism

----

> For in democracies which are subject to the law the best citizens hold the first place, and there are no demagogues; but where the laws are not supreme, there demagogues spring up.  
> -- Aristotle, Politics, Book 4

----

Liberalism is an obvious constraint

----

> Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.  
> -- James Maddison, Federalist #10

----

Illiberal constraints are also effective

## 3 
---   
## Liberalism & Pluralism

----

1. Liberalism requires the protection of individual rights
2. Protecting any right comes at the expense of other rights
3. Liberalism creates pluralism
4. Pluralism creates disagreement about which rights should be protected
5. Therefore liberalism must reconcile the pluralism it creates

----

## Private vs Public

----

## Rights & Duties

----

## Liberalism begets Pluralism

----

## Pluralism begets disagreement

---

## 4
---   
## Reconciling Liberalism

----

1. We can reconcile liberalism by imposition or acceptance
2. Imposition on reasonable beliefs is illiberal
3. Democratic reconciliation is self defeating
4. Therefore liberalism can't be reconcile except by unanimous consensus
