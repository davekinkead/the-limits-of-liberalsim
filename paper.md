# The Limits of Liberalism

This is a paper about the compatibility, or rather the limits of compatibility, or liberalism and democracy.


## Democracy & Liberalism

- democracy and liberalism are different things
- one does not entail the other
- liberalism places limits on the scope of democracy
- liberalism makes democracy more desirable

For most of the last half century, he word _democracy_ has become almost synonymous with _liberal democracy_.  This is because for much of the last 200 years, actual democracies were liberal democracies - Western Europe, North America, and The Antipodes

- examples

This conflation of democracy and liberalism, hasn't always existed however.  Athenian democracy for example, was decidedly illiberal in many respects.  Few residents were allowed to participate in the political process with suffrage limited by gender, race, and class to less than 15% of the population.  Slavery was entrenched, women were denied the right to own property, and speech was not a protected right. [cite]  2 millennia later, the Federalist Papers attempted to reconcile the conflict between these two distinct conceptions.  Maddison's famous quote in Federalist #10 captures this conflict eloquently:

> ...democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.

More recently, Fareed Zakaria has argued that the collapse of communism and subsequent transition to popular rule has heralded the rise of the illiberal democracy - a state characterised by electoral politics that "are rarely as free and fair as in the West today, but they do reflect the reality of popular participation in politics and support for those elected" [@zakaria1997:p23], but one lacking the constraints and protections for individual freedoms normally found in liberal regimes. Democracy is flourishing, he argues, but liberalism is not.

Simple linguist analysis shows how different the two terms are.  _Δημοκρατία_ or _dēmokratia_ means nothing more than the power or rule (_kratos_) of the common people (_demos_).  It was distinguished from other forms of rule by Aristotle such as _monarchy_, the rule of one, _oligarchy_, the rule of many, _aristocracy_, the rule of the best, and _timocracy_, the rule of the honourable.  Democracy is a description of _who_ wields power in a society, of who reigns and is sovereign.

Liberalism by contrast, is the doctrine of liberty.  In latin, _Liber_, a nobleman or freeman, is the antonym of _servus_ or slave. During the enlightenment, a _liberal_ meant one who was tolerant, and free from prejudice.  Liberalism as a political ideology is one that represents the primacy of individual liberty as a normative primitive, by recognising what @gaus1996 calls the _fundamental liberal assumption_ in favour of freedom.  Liberalism is a description of _what_ power can be wielded in a society, of what is subject to the claims of a sovereign and what freedoms are protected from her.

The very fact that we can conjoin the terms _liberal_ and _democracy_ implies the possibility of their conjunctive negations - illiberal democracy, liberal non-democracy, and illiberal non-democracy.  Democracy and liberalism then represent two different axes related _who_ wields power and _what_ limits that power is subject to, allowing us to conceptualise a two dimensional topography.

### Linkage

Yet the extent of the conflation, and the strong correlation between the democracy and liberalism in actual modern states, hints at a very real linkage between the two.  And while it is possible for one to exist without the other, it seems remarkable 

One data source that has been employed by a number of scholars is the Freedom House annual Freedom Survey [cite this and who uses it].

r = 0.9578

There is a significant diversity of protected freedoms found within contemporary liberal democracies, as well as how they are protected.  The United States for example, has explicit constitutional protections for ......

The United Kingdom, as birthplace of Locke and Mill who inhas a similar 



There is however, nothing necessarily liberal about democracy.  It may well be the case that societies with a liberal bent, given the power to create the laws they themselves are subject to, would create a system of government with a liberal framework; or that perhaps even the process of popular political participation (invoke Mill perhaps) leads citizens to treat each others as equals, to respect the plurality of ends within society, and thus promote tolerance.  But there is most certainly no degree of entailment, of necessity, between democracy and liberalism.

Liberalism, with its concern for liberty and freedom of the individual, operates on a different spectrum to democracy, a theory and system of government characterised by the sovereignty and source of the state's authority residing in the people.

The idea of democratic totalitarianism is illustrative of this distinction.  Consider the following hypothetical:

> Today you wake at 06:30, the time determined by the previous day's deliberations.  You eat a breakfast collectively chosen by you and your fellow citizens, dress in the manner chosen in yesterday's vote, before heading off to a job whose activities and salary are the result of collective determination.  

> Thanks to ubiquitous connectivity and intelligent artificial voting agents who can learn and be delegated to deliberate and vote on your behalf, representative government has been made redundant.  Direct, deliberative democracy is now possible and can be applied to every aspect of society.

> Equality and fairness are paramount in this regime.  Every citizen has the same rights, and is subject to the same laws, as every other.  Your claims over what you eat, do, play, and see, are no more than or less than anyone elses.  No one is above the law, none is more powerful than any other.  All are equal, as both rulers and subjects.

Whist somewhat fanciful, there is nothing _undemocratic_ about it.  Those who object simply conflate democracy with liberal democracy.  The etymology is clear. Democracy, from _demos_ and _kratos_, is simply power or rule of the people.  No restrictions to the content of their rule is indicated or implied.  Furthermore, the very fact that we can distinguish _liberal_ democracies requires at least the possibility of _illiberal_ ones.

Liberalism acts as a constraint upon what might be called raw or naked democracy.  Through constitutional constraints, due process, and structural checks and balances like the separation of powers, it limits the scope of democratic action by carving out certain rights and freedoms that are immune from collective binding action, and imposing certain duties on the state and citizens.  It requires that the private be demarcated from the public.

And in doing so, it makes democracy more desirable.

- if we value liberty, equality, and self rule, then we need to reconcile liberalism with democracy
- we can't reconcile liberalism with democracy
  - liberal democracies can be constitutional, comprehensive, or contingent
  - reconciling liberalism with democracy requires that we protect certain freedoms from the scope of democracy
  - determining which liberties should be protected democratically is self-defeating
- therefore we can't have liberalism, equality, and democracy

1. reconciling liberalism with democracy requires that we protect certain liberties from the scope of democracy 
2. liberalism and democracy can be reconciled constitutionally, comprehensively, or contingently
3. protecting any liberty necessarily impinges upon another
4. liberal societies necessarily produces disagreement on which liberties should be prioritised
7. therefore liberalism and democracy can't be reconciled comprehensively
5. determining which liberties should be protected democratically is self-defeating
6. therefore liberalism and democracy can't be reconciled constitutionally
8. democracies without constitutional or comprehensive constraints cannot be stable
9. therefore liberalism and democracy can't be reconciled contingently

Objections

1. overlapping consensus works when it is unanimous
2. but (4) liberalism produces pluralism
3. overlapping consensus is unanimous when it defines the bounds of association

- liberal democracies can be constitutional, comprehensive, or contingent

## A line in the sand

- liberalism limits the scope of democracy
- these limits are contested
- these limit cannot be determined democratically


## Putting liberalism first

- the self-defeating problem can be overcome by prioritising liberalism
- but which liberalism?
- comprehensive liberalisms are also contested
- objective liberalism based on tolerance?
- 'the fact of coercion' 


## A failure of public reason

- public reason offers a plausible solution
- this only works with unanimous agreement
- unanimous agreement is not possible


## A problem without a solution

- we want liberalism to constrain democracy
- these constraints will be contested
- we can't solve this problem democratically
- imposing comprehensive liberalism requires coercion
- public reason liberalism fails in static societies
