# The Limits of Liberalism

A rough outline of a nascent argument...

- _Democracy_ has become synonymous with _Liberal Democracy_ but this needn't be so
- Democracy can also be _illiberal_ - consider democratic totalitarianism
- But while democratic, few would consider this something to be valued
- Liberalism acts as a constraint to naked democracy, and transforms it into something to be valued
- As a constraint, it demarcates the public from the private
- But there is obvious disagreement about where this demarcation should lie
- How can these limits be determined?
- If we use democratic methods, then we render the limits vacuous
  - Democratic methods are by definition, popular - they impose a binding outcome from a collective processes
  - But the question is _which_ rights, duties, or freedoms should be immune from binding collective action
  - Thus we cannot answer this question by way of binding collective action

- C: For democracy and liberalism to be compatible, liberalism must take priority
