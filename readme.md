# The Limits of Liberalism

### Abstract

Liberalism within democratic states requires that we demarcate certain rights and duties that are immune from the binding edicts of the state.  In simplest terms, it requires us to delineate the private from the public. But as any democratic citizen is painfully aware of, exactly which rights and duties should be protected and thus restricted from public action is a deeply contested matter.

If we attempt to answer this question democratically however, we render the liberal constraints on democratic power vacuous. Specifying what is immune from collectively binding action with collectively binding action is self-defeating.  Public reason liberalism though, offers us a potential solution but as I argue in this paper, liberalism and democracy are not compatible unless we can either reach unanimous overlapping consensus or prioritise a comprehensive liberal doctrine over democratic values.

A rough outline of a nascent argument...

- Liberalism is required to make democracy something of value
  - _Democracy_ has become synonymous with _Liberal Democracy_ but this needn't be so
  - Democracy can also be _illiberal_ - consider democratic totalitarianism
  - But while democratic, few would consider this something to be valued
  - Liberalism acts as a constraint to naked democracy, and transforms it into something to be valued
- Liberalism demarcates the public from the private
- But there is obvious disagreement about where this demarcation should lie
- How can these limits be determined?
- If we use democratic methods, then we render the limits vacuous
  - Democratic methods are by definition, popular - they impose a binding outcome from a collective processes
  - But the question is _which_ rights, duties, or freedoms should be immune from binding collective action
  - Thus we cannot answer this question by way of binding collective action
- If we use non-democratic methods, then they must be agreed to or imposed
- Ignore imposition accounts for time being
- How do we get agreement?
- Unanimous agreement avoids the problem
  - If we all willingly accept the limit, then collective binding action is unnecessary
  - Public reason liberalism offers a viable mechanism for this
- But what of reasonable disagreement?


- C: For democracy and liberalism to be compatible, liberalism must take priority
- bite the bullet and accept comprehensive liberalism takes priority over democracy
